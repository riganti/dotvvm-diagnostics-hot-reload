# DotVVM.Diagnostics.ViewHotReload

This package extends [DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm) with a **hot reload** feature for markup files. 

Whenever you edit any markup file, the page is automatically refreshed while the viewmodel state is kept - this allows to speed up developer inner loop experience.
